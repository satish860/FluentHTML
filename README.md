FluentHTML
==========

Fluent HTML is light weight html helper which just does one thing --Generate HTML

Why another HTML helper ?
    1) Partially because i want to use the MVC HTML helper with Webapi formatter ,Which is not possible because of the ViewContext,RequestConext etc .. Some one is MVC team has weird love for Context.
  2) Job of HTML Helpers is to Generate HTML and it should be easy enough to just generate it and test it
  3) There is no reason for using IDictionary<object,object> every where rather than providing a good and easy enough api to guide it.That drives the fluent API design of the HTML.


Consideration with other open HTML helpers 
        Stay tuned.
